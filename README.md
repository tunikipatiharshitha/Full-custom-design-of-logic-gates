Cadence design tools are heavily used in the design and simulation of Integrated circuits.While experimenting on this tool, it gives a kind of joy and creates a passion to learn and to work on it. Here are the basic layout designs that I have designed using Cadence virtuoso. 
## Layout Designs:
### Inverter:
